#This code is made when i have a csv file having a singke column Charge and values are writeen like min charge to max charge so i want to divide them into two seperate columns 
# Min Charge Max Charge

import csv

filename = "/Users/ayeshaferoz/Documents/Res=35k,noise=0/Files/combined_data2.csv"  # replace with your CSV file path
charge_col_name = "Charge"  # replace with the name of the charge column in your CSV file
min_charge_col_name = "Min Charge"
max_charge_col_name = "Max Charge"

# open the CSV file
with open(filename, "r") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    # create a new CSV file with additional columns for min and max charges
    with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as outfile:
        fieldnames = reader.fieldnames + [min_charge_col_name, max_charge_col_name]
        writer = csv.DictWriter(outfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        # iterate over each row in the CSV file
        for row in reader:
            # extract the charge value and split it into min and max charges
            charge_str = row[charge_col_name]
            min_charge, max_charge = map(int, charge_str.split("to"))

            # add the min and max charge values to the row
            row[min_charge_col_name] = min_charge
            row[max_charge_col_name] = max_charge
            # write the updated row to the output CSV file
            writer.writerow(row)
